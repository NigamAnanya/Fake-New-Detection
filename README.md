# Fake News Detection  

This project focuses on identifying and classifying news articles as either **real** or **fake** using **Machine Learning** techniques and **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** workflows. The objective is to build a robust classifier that can assist in combating the spread of misinformation.

---

## Features  
- Implementation of **Machine Learning models** for fake news classification.  
- Extensive **data preprocessing** to handle unstructured text data.  
- Feature extraction using **TF-IDF** and **CountVectorizer** techniques.  
- Evaluation of model performance using various classification metrics.

---

## Tools & Technologies  
- **Programming Language**: Python  
- **Libraries**: 
  - **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis.  
  - **Matplotlib**: Visualizations of data and model results.  
  - **sklearn**: Machine learning model implementation and evaluation.  
- **Algorithms**: Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machines (SVM).  

---

## Workflow  
1. **Data Preprocessing**:  
   - Cleaned the dataset to remove missing values, duplicates, and unnecessary columns.  
   - Normalized text data by removing punctuation, stopwords, and applying lemmatization.  

2. **Feature Engineering**:  
   - Extracted features from text using **TF-IDF** and **CountVectorizer** methods.  

3. **Model Training & Evaluation**:  
   - Implemented machine learning algorithms like **Naive Bayes**, **Logistic Regression**, and **SVM**.  
   - Evaluated models using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to select the best-performing model.  

4. **Visualization**:  
   - Visualized dataset distributions and model performance metrics using **Matplotlib**.
